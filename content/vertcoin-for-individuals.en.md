Vertcoin is the easiest way to transact at a very low cost, meaning credit cards no longer have a monopoly on the finance industry.


# Mobile payments made easy


Vertcoin when used on a mobile device allows you to pay with a simple two-step scan-and-pay. There's no need to sign up, swipe your card, type a PIN, or sign anything. All you need to receive Vertcoin payments is to display the QR code in your Vertcoin wallet app and let the other party scan your mobile, or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology).



# You're in control


As one of the most mature coins on the market (since 2014) Vertcoin transactions are secure. Your money is safe because you have all the control. You’ve got the power to authorise a payment and no one can make a payment on your behalf. As long as you protect your wallet’s login details, Vertcoin gives you complete control over your money and a strong level of protection against multiple types of fraud.



# Always on, everywhere


Vertcoin has been around since 2014 with a dedicated worldwide community of full nodes, it has one of the highest full node counts of any cryptocurrency.  
Send and receive money on any platform that accepts Vertcoin because they are all compatible as they use the same open technology. Vertcoin is always ready to send.



# A world without borders


Sending Vertcoin across borders is as easy as sending them across the street. There are no banks to make you wait three business days, no extra fees for making an international transfer, and no special limitations on the minimum or maximum amount you can send.




# Control your fees


There is no fee to receive Vertcoins. And if you’re making payments, you control how large a fee to pay when spending. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it’s possible to send 1,000,000 Vertcoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 Vertcoin. 


# Privacy Management

With Vertcoin, there's no credit card number that malicious actors can collect in order to steal from you. In fact, it's even possible in some cases to send a payment without revealing your identity, almost like with physical money. You should, however, take note that some effort can be required to protect your privacy.
