# Control your fees

There is no fee to receive Vertcoins. And if you’re making payments, you control how large a fee to pay when spending. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it’s possible to send 1,000,000 Vertcoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 Vertcoin. 


# Fraud Protection

Vertcoin payments are irreversible and secure so as a business you can forget about fraud. 
Also, thanks to extremely low fees, you may easily refund Vertcoins with little impact to your business. 


# Borderless Payments

Sending Vertcoin across borders is as easy as sending them across the street. There are no banks to make you wait three business days, no extra fees for making an international transfer, and no special limitations on the minimum or maximum amount you can send.


# Accept payments instantly 

As a merchant, we know you’ve jumped through hoops to obtain security checks in order to comply with the PCI standard. The good news is that with Vertcoin you don’t have to worry about that ever again. The even better news is that you do not carry the costs and responsibilities that come with processing sensitive information from your customers like credit card numbers. Vertcoin still requires you to secure your wallet and your payment requests, but you’ll find that you do that already.


# Merchant Adoption


With over 40 million Vertcoins in circulation Vertcoin is the world’s newest burgeoning market searching for ways to spend their coins. With fractional outlay expenses this is one of the better better decisions you will make. 
Accepting them is a good way to get new customers and give your business some new visibility. Accepting a new payment method has often shown to be a clever practice for online businesses.



# Multi-signature

Vertcoin also includes a multi-signature feature which allows Vertcoin to be spent only if a subset of a group of people authorize the transaction. Similar to general consensus, this means that payments can only be validated with enough consent from other members and that ensures valid transactions.


# Clean Accounting


Vertcoin makes accounting very transparent. As a business or not for profit you may produce accounting documents to outline activity. Achieve the highest level of transparency using Vertcoin. With a few clicks you can provide information that your members can then use to verify your balances and transactions. Non-profit organizations can also allow the public to see how much they receive in donations.
